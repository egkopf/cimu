         When Kaci was a child, most of her clothes were frilly, victorian-inspired hand-me-downs from her cousin that
         were two sizes too big. Knowing that the clothes weren't going to help her blend in in suburban Georgia, Kaci
         taught herself how to alter her clothes by watching YouTube videos. This childhood practice caused Kaci to
         develop a strong interest in clothing utilization and ultimately led her to build Cimu.

            <h3 style="font-weight: bold;color:#C36BAB;"> Reduce Reverse Logistics </h3>
            <p> Our alterations and network of tailors ensure that only clothes with issues that can't be solved with a
               tailor end up in your returns pile. By reforming your returns process, we are reducing the number of
               returns overall. </p>

            <p> Cimu can turn garments from something customers like into something customers love. By allowing your
               customers to tailor their clothes to perfection, we're helping them feel more empowered and confident
               wearing your apparel. Additionally, over time, we will be able to collect microdata from our alterations
               that will better inform the manufacturing process.</p>

            <p> By making sure clothes successfully enter customers' closets, we're ensuring that clothes don't end up
               in landfills. We are increasing clothing utilization and decreasing clothing waste. In doing so, we are
               driving the heart of a circular economy.</p>

            <p> Our network of tailors include traditional tailors and community members. Many community members don't
               have the economic means to create a tailoring shop but have sewing capabilities that rival those with
               storefronts. By employing former unhoused folks, refugees, and stay-at-home moms, we're empowering the local community through economic means.</p>
